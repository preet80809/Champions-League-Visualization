# **Champions-league Visualization project**

*I created a comprehensive visualization of the UEFA Champions League data using Python. The project was designed to analyze and visualize various aspects of the tournament, providing insights into team performances, player statistics, and overall trends.
The primary libraries used for this project were pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.*

1.  **Data Collection**  --  Libraries Used: "pandas", "numpy"
   ---
   
  - Imported the Champions League dataset using "pandas".

  - Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating new features where necessary.
    
    

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  --  Libraries Used: "matplotlib", "seaborn".
   
   ---

  - Conducted EDA to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

  - Used matplotlib and seaborn to generate various plots such as histograms and line graphs.

  - Visualized the distribution of goals scored (left footed or right footed), Fouls committed, and Player with more assists.

  - Highlighted top-performing teams and their key statistics.

  - Compared player performances across different teams.
    

 3. **Conclusion and Insights**
